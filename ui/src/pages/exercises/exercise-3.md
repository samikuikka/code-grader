#  Budget check

Write a function `String budgetCheck(double budget, double currentSpending)` that returns information on whether a given budget is in order in light of given spending. If the value of currentSpending is larger than the value of budget, the function should return "Budget: Overspending". Otherwise, the function should return "Budget: OK".
